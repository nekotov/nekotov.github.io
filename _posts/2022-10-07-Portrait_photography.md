## Portrait photo

* When choosing a lens, consider the following::

A standard portrait lens can be considered a 50 mm fixed lens. Keep in mind that in front of a digital camera, this lens has a focal length of 75 mm due to the size of the sensor, which makes it impossible to get particularly close to the model. This should be taken into account, especially when photographing in a narrow space. At the same time, the Canon 50mm 1:1.4 D lens has an excellent aperture, a pattern with good sharpness and excellent color reproduction.

When using a telephoto lens, there are many positive arguments. First, due to the longer focal length, telephoto lenses with a more open aperture have a lower depth of field, which gives portrait photography a pleasant Foggy background and, thanks to this, better brings the person depicted to the foreground.

When using a wide-angle lens, in addition to the image, it is also possible to bring the environment to the fore. However, please note that the person being photographed is not very close to the camera! When using a wide-angle lens, distortion inevitably occurs. If this is not intentional, then keep in mind that photographing a face with a wide-angle lens, you can get, depending on the angle of shooting, for example, a large nose and small ears...

## Using light

Different uses of light determine the emotional tone of portrait photography. When using natural light, you can take into account countless possibilities that are determined by the intensity of natural light, the temperature of light, the angle of incidence and reflection, cloud cover, and the nature of the shooting location. This is not to say that some light situation is absolutely not suitable for portrait photography. Although photographing, for example, at noon in sunlight is a certain headache, when there are no clouds in the sky that soften the light, the model tries to squint her eyes because of the brightness of sunlight, and the shadow zones remain underexposed or just black in the photo, and again some light zone "burns out".

This is one of the reasons why photographers like to take pictures when the sun is hidden by clouds. Some tricks when shooting in high-contrast natural light:

Use a white reflector to direct light into the shadow area. Its use ensures that you get light in the shadow area with a natural color temperature. When using a silver reflector, the reflected light will be slightly colder and more contrasting. The gold reflector gives a warmer light. When using a reflector, there is a rule that the size of the reflector must be equal to the size of the photographed object remaining in the frame.

Use a flash lamp to fill it with light. Here, I would advise against using a full-click Flash, if you don't have enough experience, then you should use the test sketch method to adjust the flash strength downwards from half to two f-stops to match the overall brightness. The flash of the flash lamp softens the shadows, gives shine to the eyes of the person depicted and makes the colors in the foreground a little brighter.

## Composition and emotions

When shooting in the field, a big advantage over studio shooting is that you can use an environment with a fairly diverse character that combines or contrasts with the person depicted. The second advantage when performing portrait photography in the field is the space, which makes it very easy to photograph the model in motion or during action. The ability to use the shooting location in a portrait as an additional element describing the dimensions is one of the necessary techniques for the photographer's skill. The emotional charge of a portrait photo depends on the pose of the person being depicted, the facial expression, the general lighting scheme, colors (or lack thereof), the composition that gives the photo dynamics or, conversely, static, etc.

If the photographer has thought through all the technical nuances that guarantee the necessary technical quality of the photo before shooting, then working with the model is no less important. One of the possibilities is to make a portrait in the form of a snapshot, when the photographer, observing what is happening, captures the right moment, which usually happens accidentally and unexpectedly on the part of the photographer. If we are talking about photos with posing, then it is extremely necessary to explain to the person depicted what result the photographer expects, help him find the right pose, facial expression or mood. A good portrait photo in most cases is the result of successful work of the photographer and the person depicted. Already in the process of photographing, the created photo should be emotionally charged, the result can only be slightly changed and highlighted by subsequent computer processing.
