## Photo

**Photography** is the art of creating photography based on phototechnology, reflecting the creative vision of the photographer as an artist. It is considered one of the Fine Arts and occupies one of the key places in modern popular culture.

Photography is characterized by a significant variety of technical means and a wealth of visual language. Works of photographic art can be either an artistic invention or an artistic document and are contrasted with household and commercial photography, which is used to advertise goods and services.

Some photography theorists point out that photography differs from other arts by the secondary importance of style compared to what is depicted, and therefore by the weakened personality of the author: "many published photographs of outstanding Masters seem to have been taken by another talented professional of the same period".
